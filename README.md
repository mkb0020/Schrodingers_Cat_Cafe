🐱☕ Schrödinger’s Cat Café
A regression modeling app inspired by Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment.
In this café, your dining experience depends entirely on quantum uncertainty—and a bit of data science.
The app takes a dataset of quantum-themed features, including:
•	📦 Box Temperature
•	🔦 Photon Count
•	🔗 Quantum Entanglement Index
•	👀 Observer Presence (0 = not watching, 1 = observing)
•	☢️ Radioactive Decay Rate
•	🌊 Wave Function Stability
•	🪨 Box Material
From these, the app builds regression models to predict three crucial outcomes:
•	Mood Score (0–100): from existential dread (0) to quantum bliss (100)
•	Alive Probability (1–100): how likely the cat is still with us
•	Quantum Sass Index: how snarky the cat will be if you order a latte
Why it matters
•	A happy cat = a great meal at the Cat Café
•	A cat in existential dread = wrong orders (hope you like extra tomatoes)
•	A dead cat = no meal at all
•	A sassy cat = sarcastic barista energy, prepare yourself
This project is both a tribute to quantum mechanics and a hands-on way to explore regression analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling—all wrapped up in a purrfect experience.
